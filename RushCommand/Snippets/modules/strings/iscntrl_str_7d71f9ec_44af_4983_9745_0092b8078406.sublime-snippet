<description>pChecks if each character in codestr/code is a control character. A control character is a character that does not occupy a printing position on a display (this is the opposite of a printable character checked with isprint). For the standard ASCII character set (used by the "C" locale) control characters are those between ASCII codes 0x00 (NUL) and 0x1f (US) plus 0x7f (DEL)./ppstrongstr/strong: String to be checked/ppstrongreturns/strong: True if all characters in the string are control characters. False otherwise./p</description>
